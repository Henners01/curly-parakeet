# Xmx and Xms set the maximum and minimum RAM usage, respectively.
# They can take any number, followed by an M or a G.
# M means Megabyte, G means Gigabyte.
# For example, to set the maximum to 3GB: -Xmx3G
# To set the minimum to 2.5GB: -Xms2500M

# A good default for a modded server is 4GB.
# Uncomment the next line to set it.
# -Xms16G -Xmx22G -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=500
# Edit from StormDragon_64: I would recommend to set it to 4.5GB, or even 5GB for the extra headroom, 
# but 4 is enough if you don't have too many players online.
